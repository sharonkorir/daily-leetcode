## 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.


**Examples**


`Example 1:`

```python
- Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
- Output: [1,3,6,10]
- Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```

`Example 2:`

```python
- Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
- Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
- Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
```
